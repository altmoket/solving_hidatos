# Hidatos

## Project Description
Hidato is a logic game created by Dr. Gyora Benedek, an Israeli mathematician. The objective of the game is to fill a board with consecutive numbers that connect horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project has been developed as part of the Declarative Programming course.

## Programming Language Used
- **Haskell**: A functional programming language that allows for the creation of concise and declarative programs.

## Project Members
- **Lidier Robaina**
- **Leandro Hernandez**

## How to Use
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the source code** using GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler):
   ```bash
   ghc Main.hs clibrary/lib.c -o Main
   ./Main
   ```

## Main Features

- **Board Generation**: 
  - Create random or predefined boards to play.
  
- **Move Validation**: 
  - Check if the entered numbers comply with the game's rules.
  
- **User Interface**: 
  - Provide a simple interface for interacting with the game.

- **Solution Finder**: 
  - Implement algorithms to find solutions for given Hidato puzzles.

- **Difficulty Levels**: 
  - Allow users to select different difficulty levels that affect the size and complexity of the board.

- **Save and Load Game**: 
  - Enable users to save their current game state and load it later.
